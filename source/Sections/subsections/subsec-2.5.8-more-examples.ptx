    Now we will give some more examples:

<example>
    <ol marker="(A)">
        <li>
            <p>
                For every odd prime <m>x</m> less than 10, <m>x^2+4</m> is prime
                <me>(\forall x)(x\text{ is prime }\wedge x\text{ is odd }\wedge x\lt 10\implies x^2+4\text{ is prime}</me>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some functions defined at 0 are not continuous at zero
                <me>(\exists f)(f\text{ is defined at }0\wedge f\text{ is not continuous at }0</me>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some integers are even and some integers are odd
                <me>(\exists x)(x\text{ is even})\wedge(\exists y)(y\text{ is odd})</me>
            </p>
        </li>
