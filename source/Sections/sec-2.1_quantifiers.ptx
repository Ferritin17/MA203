  <title>Set theory notation</title>
  <p>Set theory is super important. We will be spending a lot of time with it. Right now, let's start with the very basics and define some things.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><term>Set</term>: A collection of stuff (or nothing).</li>
      <li><term>Element</term>: The stuff in the set.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The elements in a set do not have a particular order, so you can think of a set like a "magical bag" that holds things.</p>
  <p>Set theory, like everything, comes with its own special notation. We often denote sets with a capital letter, and elements with a lower case letter.
  The symbol <m>\in </m> can be read as "in" or "is an element of." For example, "<m>x \in A</m>" would be read as "x in A," or, "x, an element of the set A."</p>
  <p>We know from the previous chapter that <m>3x=12</m> is not a proposition, since it has a variable. But, to write this in logical terms, we could say
    "There exists an integer, x, with the property 3x=12." In symbols, this looks like:</p>
  <p><m>\exists x \in \mathbb{Z} </m> such that <m>3x+12</m></p>
  <p><m>\exists</m> is called the "existential quantifier" and is often read as, "there exists." <m>\mathbb{Z} </m> is simply the symbol for the integers,
    just as <m>\mathbb{N} </m> is the symbol for the natural numbers. Its purpose here is to establish the "universe" that we're making the statement in.</p>
  <p><m>\forall </m> is what we call the "universal quantifier," and is usually read "for all," or, "for every." For example,</p>
  <p>Where <m>p =</m> people, and <m>\mathcal{U} =</m> the universe containing people: <m>\forall p \in \mathcal{U} </m>, <m>p</m> likes pizza.</p>
  <p>Translation: "All people (everybody) likes pizza."</p>
  <p>It is also important to note what the negation of each of these quantifiers is.</p>
  <p>~<m>\exists </m> read literally says, "There does not exist." Sometimes it is helpful to read this as "everybody doesn't."</p>
  <p>~<m>\forall </m> says "not all," which can be thought of as, "somebody does."</p>
  <p></p>
  <example>
    <ul>
        <li><m>\exists n \in \mathbb{Z} </m> such that <m>n &lt; 0</m>: "Some integers are negative."</li>
        <li><m>\forall p \in \mathcal{U}</m>, <m>Z(p)</m>: "Everyone makes mistakes." (Where <m>\mathcal{U} =</m> people in the world, and <m>Z(p)=</m>person makes mistakes)</li>
        <li>~<m>\forall p\in \mathcal{U}</m>, <m>G(p)</m>: "Someone will get an A" (Where <m>\mathcal{U} =</m> people in the world, and <m>G(p)=</m>person makes mistakes)</li>
    </ul>  
    <p>The next two show the same statement written two ways.</p>
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <ul>
          <li>~<m>(\forall n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>  <m>\sqrt{n} \in \mathbb{Z}</m>: *NOT*(For all integers <m>n</m>, <m>\sqrt{n}</m> is an integer)</li>
          <li><m>(\exists n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>  <m>\sqrt{n} \not\in \mathbb{Z}</m>: For some integers <m>n</m>, <m>\sqrt{n}</m> is not an integer.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>~<m>(\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>  <m>n^2 =5)</m>: *NOT*(There exists an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2 =5</m></li>
          <li><m>\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}</m>  <m>n^2 \neq 5</m>: For all integers <m>n</m>, <m>n^2</m> does not equal <m>5</m>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </example>
