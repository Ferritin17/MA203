<title>The Universal Quantifier</title>

<p><m>\forall </m> is what we call the "universal quantifier," and is usually read "for all," or, "for every." For example,</p>
  <p>Where <m>p =</m> people, and <m>\mathcal{U} =</m> the universe containing people: <m>\forall p \in \mathcal{U} </m>, <m>p</m> likes pizza.</p>
  <p>Translation: "All people (everybody) likes pizza."</p>
