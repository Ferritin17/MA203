    <p>
        Some examples of relations on <m>\mathbb{R}</m>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\mathbb{R}: = (a,b)\not\in = \rightarrow a\neq b</m>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}: \leq (a,b)\in \leq \rightarrow a\leq b</m>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <title>Zoo Relation</title>
        <p>
            Let's look at a set of animals in the zoo <m>A=</m> {giraffe, elephant, turtle}, and a set of foods they eat
            <m>F:</m> {leaf, peanut, pizza}. Call <m>E</m> the relationship between <m>A</m> and <m>F</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>A relation is a subset of the cross product of <m>A</m> and <m>F</m></alert>. Things in <m>E</m> are ordered pairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>E=</m> {(giraffe, leaf), (elephant, peanut), (turtle, pizza), (turtle, leaf)}
        </p>

    <p>
        <alert>Inverse of Relations</alert>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <alert>Prove:</alert> Dom(<m>R^-1</m>) = Rng(<m>R</m>)</p>
    <p>
        Don't forget, to prove equality of sets, you must prove both subsets!

    <p>
        [<m>\subset</m>] 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let <m>a \in \text{dom}(R^-1)</m>. Hence by definition of domain, we can find <m>b\in B</m> such that <m>aR^-1b</m>.
        Hence, by definition of inverse, <m>bRa</m>. Since <m>b\in B</m>, by definition of range, <m>a\in \text{rng}(R)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        [<m>\supset</m>] 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let <m>a \in \text{dom}(R^-1)</m>. Hence, by definition of domain, we can find <m>b \in B</m> such that <m>aR^-1b</m>.
        Hence, by definition of inverse, <m>bRa</m>. Since <m>b\in B</m>, by definition of range, <m>a\in \text{Rng}(R)</m>.

    <theorem>
        <title></title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Composition of relations is associative.
            </p>
            <me>
                T\circ (S\circ R)=(T\circ S)\circ R
            </me>
            
        </statement>
      </theorem> 
      <proof>
        <p>
            Suppose that <m>A, B, C, \text{ and } D</m> are sets. Let <m>R</m> be a relation from
            <m>A \text{ to } B</m>, <m>S</m> be a relation from <m>B \text{ to } C</m>, and <m>T</m>
            be a realtion from <m>C\text { to } D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we are proving an equality, we will have to prove both subsets. In this case, the first 
            subset we want to show is that <m>T\circ (S\circ R)\subset A\times D</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            [<m>\subset</m>]
        </p>
        <p>
            Let <m>(x,y)\in T\circ (S\circ R)</m> <alert>NOTE (this is super important to remember and not mix up): <m>(x,y)</m> is an 
            <em>ordered pair</em>.</alert> By definition of composition, we can find <m>z\in C</m> such that <m>(z,y)\in T</m>
            and <m>(x,z)\in (S\circ R)</m>. Thus by definition of composition, we can find <m>w\in B</m> such that 
            <m>(x,w)\in R \text{ and } (w,z)\in S</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since <m>z\in C \text{ and } (z,y)\in T, \text{ and } (w,z)\in S</m> then <m>(w,y)\in (T\circ S)</m>. And since <m>w\in B \text{ and }
                (x,w)\in R</m>, then <m>(x,y)\in (T\circ S)\circ R</m>
        </p>
      </proof>
