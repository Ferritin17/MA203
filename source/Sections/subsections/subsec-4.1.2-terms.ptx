<title>Our Terms</title>


    <p>Now, in order to start proving things we need the objects we are going to prove them about.
        In addition when we begin our journey in proving, I'd like to limit the moving pieces 
        so we have those few assumptions just listed, but <alert>most importantly</alert> we need definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
        To make sure our playground is small enough that no one hurts themselves, but large enough that we can actually
        get some <em>real</em> proving in we'll start with a few common defintions, namely odd, even, and divides.
        </p>

    <p>
        <assemblage permid="pOu">
            <title>Even</title>
            <p permid="vSb">
                <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x</m> is <term>even</term> iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> x=2k</m>
            </p>
          </assemblage>
    </p>

    <p>
        <assemblage permid="pOu">
            <title>Odd</title>
            <p permid="vSb">
                <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x</m> is <term>even</term> iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> x=2k+1</m>
                
            </p>
          </assemblage>
    </p>
    <p>
        <assemblage permid="pOu">
            <title>Divides</title>
            <p permid="vSb">
                <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>y\in\Z</m>, we say <m>x</m> <term>divides</term>
                 <m>y</m> iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> y=kx</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                The notation for <m>x</m> divides <m>y</m> is <m>x|y</m>
            </p>
          </assemblage>
    </p>

    <p>It is important to become so familiar with these that you could say them in your sleep.</p>
