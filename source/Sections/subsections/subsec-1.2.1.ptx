    <p>When is a compound proposition true? "And" statements are only true when both parts are true. "Or" statements are true when at least one of them is true. However, it does not exclude both from being true. This is what we call an <term>inclusive or</term>.</p>
    <p>Consider the statement "I will do my homework tonight or I will watch Star Wars." It is true if you do your homework. It is also true if you watch Star Wars. More importantly, it is true if you do both.</p>
    <p>Now consider the statement "If I am elected, I will lower taxes." This is true if the politician in question gets elected <em>and</em> lowers taxes. It is also true if he does not get elected, but still somehow manages to lower taxes. It is <em>not</em> true however, if he gets elected and does not lower taxes.</p>
    <p>So far we have only looked at statements with two propositions. What if there are more? How would we determine the truth value of such a complicated statement as <m>(P\vee Q)\wedge [</m>~<m>(P\wedge Q)]</m>?</p>
