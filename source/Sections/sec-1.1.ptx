  <title>Propositions</title>

  <p>A proposition is a statement that can take only one of two values: truth or false. Propositions do not have variables.</p>
  <p>Propositions can be combined using connectives, such as "and" and "or."</p>

  <example>
    <Example>
    <p>P= a statement: "It is raining outside."</p>
    <p>Q= a statement: "I have an umbrella."</p>
    <p>We can combine these statements with <m>wedge</m>AND SYMBOL to get: P AND SYMBOL Q: It is raining outside, and I have an umbrella.</p>
