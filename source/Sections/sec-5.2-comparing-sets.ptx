<title>Comparing and Combining Sets</title>
<p>
    Now we will begin comparing sets. Our first tool of comparison is the concept of subset.

<definition xml:id="defn-subset">
    <title>Subset</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
           We say that the set <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of a set <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\subseteq B</m>, if and only if for all <m>x\in\mathcal{U}</m>, <me>x \in A \implies x \in B</me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    To say that in more plain language, <m>A\subseteq B</m> means <m>B</m> contains all the elements of <m>A</m>, it is noteworthy that <m>B</m> may contain more than just those elements from <m>A</m>.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        Define the sets
    </p>
    <p>
        *picture*
    </p>
    <p>
        notice that every element from <m>A</m> can also be found in <m>B</m>.
    </p>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        Define the sets 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=6a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
        </me>
        <me>
            B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Notice that <m>A\subseteq B</m> since for any <m>x\in A</m> we can find an integer <m>a</m> such that 
        <me>
            x=6a=2\cdot(3a)
        </me>
        and since <m>3a</m> is an integer by definition <m>x\in B</m>.
    </p>
