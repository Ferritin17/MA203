<title>Prove: If <m>x</m> is odd, then <m>x+1</m> is even.</title>

    <p>Although you'll soon find that there is not an algorithm for writing a proof, let's break this first proof down, step by step, using 
        our proof writing song:</p>
    <p>"What's the P?" <m>x</m> is odd</p>
    <p>"What's the Q?" <m>x+1</m> is even</p>
    <p>"What're the definitions?" Odd and even (the only ones we have so far)!</p>
    <p>"Now, what to do?" A direct proof!</p>

    <p>First, we need to "shovel off" the hidden quantifier (<m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}</m>): "Let x be an integer."</p>
    <p>Next, assume the "P." "Assume <m>x</m> is odd."</p>
    <p>Now use the definitions. (It can be helpful, especially in these early stages of proof writing, to write the relevant definitions to the side in your scratch work)
        "Thus, by the definition of odd, we can find an integer <m>k</m> so that <m>x=2k+1</m>." This is our first conclusion.</p>
    <p>Now we need to actually <em>do</em> something with that. "Hence calculate:</p>
    
    <md>
        <mrow>x+1\amp=(2k+1)+1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=k+2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=2(k+1)</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>The <m>x+1</m> on the left of this equation is the end conclusion we're "aiming for." The stuff on the right is what we manipulate to make it 
        "look like," or "fit," the definition of even.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we can make our conclusion. "Since <m>k+1</m> is an integer, by definition of even, <m>x+1</m> is even."</p>

    <p>Once you put all the pieces together, the proof would read:</p>
    <p>"Let <m>x</m> be an integer. Assume <m>x</m> is odd. Thus, by the definition of odd, we can find an integer <m>k</m> so that 
        <m>x=2k+1</m>. Calculate:</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>x+1\amp=(2k+1)+1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=k+2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=2(k+1)</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Since <m>k+1</m> is an integer, by definition of even, <m>x+1</m> is even. QED"</p>

    <note>
        <p>To show that a proof is finished, we write "QED" at the bottom. This comes from the Latin "quod erat demonstrandum," which means 
            "that which was to be demonstrated."</p>
