<title>Families</title>

    We now consider, basic constructions like union, intersection and the cross product between many sets at once. We consider these over a <term>family of sets</term>, which is just a fancy way of saying a set whose members are sets. We will most often use the <em>script font</em> to indicate a family, for example <m>\mathscr{A}</m>.

        <p>
            Let <m>\Delta</m> be a nonempty set such that for every <m>i\in\Delta</m> we correspond a set <m>A_i</m>. An <term>indexed family of sets</term> over <m>\Delta</m>, is the family of sets, 
            <me>
                \mathscr{A}=\{A_i\text{ }|\text{ }i\in\Delta\}
            </me>
            
            We call the set <m>\Delta</m> <term> the indexing set</term>.

           The indexed family <m>\mathscr{A} = \{A_\alpha | \alpha \in \Delta\}</m> of sets is pairwise disjoint
            if for all <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> in <m>\Delta</m>, either <m>A_\alpha = A_\beta</m>
            or <m>A_\alpha \cap A_\beta = \emptyset</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, the sets are completely the same, or completely different.
