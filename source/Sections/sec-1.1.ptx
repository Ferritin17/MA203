<title>Propositions and Connectives</title>
<p>
    In English, as it is in many languages, there are many types of sentences, some more complicated than others. We will
    now be concerning ourselves with if a sentence is true. This is the hallmark of proving, by only writting sentences
    that are true our conclusions are then true.  
</p>
<p>
    It doesn't make sense to say that any sentence that you could write is true or not. For example a <em>question</em> 
    such as <em>"Where is my phone"</em> or an exlamatory sentence like <em>"Oh No!"</em>. Both of these examples are 
    indeed complete sentences, as in they express a complete thought, but are neither true nor false.
</p>
<definition>
<p>A <term>proposition</term> is a sentence that can take only one of two values: truth or false. 
    </p>
</definition>

    <example xml:id="prop-example">
        <title>Some Examples of Propostions</title>
        <p>The following are examples of propositions:</p>
        <ol marker="(A)">
            <li>It is raining.</li>
            <li><m>2+5=4</m></li>
            <li>The gazel will become the only living animal on earth by the year 2525.</li>
            <li>Galileo Galilei had bacon on his eleventh birthday.</li>
        </ol>
    </example></p>
   <p>
    here write some stuff about the last example...

                <title>Some Examples of Sentences that are not Propositions</title>
                
                
       <p> The following are sentences that are NOT propositions:</p>
       <ol marker="(A)">
            <li>She has my phone.</li>
            <li>Stop!</li>
            <li><m>x+2=4</m></li>
            <li>This sentence is false.</li>
            </ol>
    </example>
</p>
<p>
    here walk through the each letter and mention important stuff about them... such as the last one is a <term>paradox</term>
</p>
<p>
    In <xref ref="prop-example" /> the propositions are all <term>simple</term> or <term>atomic</term> in the senese
    that they do not have any other propositions as components. <term>Compound</term> propositions can be formed by using connective words, 
    connecting more than one propostion.

    <p>Given propositions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,</p>
    <statement>

        The <term>conjunction</term> of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, denoted <m>P\wedge Q</m>,
        is the proposition:

        <p>

<!--disjuncation defintion-->
<definition ml:id="def-disjunction">
    <p>Given propositions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,</p>
<statement>
    <p>The <term>disjunction</term> of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, denoted <m>P\vee Q</m>, 
        is the proposition:</p>
        <p>"<m>P</m> <alert>or</alert> <m>Q</m>"</p>
        <p><m>P\vee Q</m> is true exactly 
            when <em>at least one of</em> <m>P</m> or <m>Q</m> are true.</p>
        </statement> 
</definition>
<p>some blah... about disjunction</p>
<p>
    The logical disjunciton is often reffered to as the <term>inclusive or</term>, as it is still true when both
    propositions are true. In English we often assume the use of the <term>exclusive or</term>, that is, when we use
    the word <em>or</em>
</p>

<!--negation defintion-->
<definition xml:id="def-negation">
    <p>Given a proposition <m>P</m>,</p>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The negation of <m>P</m>, denoted <m>\sim P</m>, is the propositon
        </p>
        <p>
            "<alert>not</alert> <m>P</m>"
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\sim P</m> is true exactly when <m>P</m> is false.
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
    <p>We often want to negate statements, for which we use <m>\sim </m> or <m>\neg</m> as <term>not</term>.</p>

    <example>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "It is raining outside."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I have an umbrella."</p>
                <p><m>P\wedge Q </m> : It is raining outside and I have an umbrella.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I will go to the store tonight"</p>
                <p><m>~P</m> : "I will not go to the store tonight."</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I will do my homework."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I will watch Star Wars."</p>
                <p><m>P\vee Q</m> : "I will do my homework or I will watch Star Wars."</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I will do the dishes tonight."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I am cooking tonight."</p>
                <p><m>P\wedge (\sim Q)</m> : "I will do the dishes tonight, and I am not cooking tonight."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </example>

    <p>There is another way to relate two propositions, that is, with an <term>implication</term>, which is written like this: <m>\implies</m>.</p>
    <example>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I am cooking tonight."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I will do the dishes."</p>
                <p><m>P\implies Q</m> : "If I am cooking tonight, then I will do the dishes."</p>
                <p><m>P\implies (\sim Q)</m> : "If I am cooking tonight, then I will not do the dishes."</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I am elected."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I will lower taxes."</p>
                <p><m>P\implies Q</m> : "If I am elected, then I will lower taxes."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
