<title>Obviously</title>
<p>
    When writting a proof a challenging task is to decipher what is obvious. The rule I make in my class is that you 
    should write so that ANYONE in the class would have no questions to how you got to the next step. 

</p>
<p>
    To convolude the manner even more there are places where I believe that everyone of my students would call the step 
    obvious but the homework will ask you to prove as an assignment. And throughtout 
    (especially as we are first starting out) I will note times that you are NOT allowed to take something as obvious.
