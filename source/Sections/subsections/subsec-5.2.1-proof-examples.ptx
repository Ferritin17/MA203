<title>Examples of Proofs with Set Theory</title>

    <example>
        <p><alert>Prove:</alert> <m>A \subset B</m> if and only if <m>P(A) \subset P(B)</m></p>
        <p>[<m>\implies</m>]</p>
        <p>Assume <m>A \subset B</m> Let <m>x \in P(A)</m>. Hence by definition of power set, <m>x \subset P(A)</m></p>
        <p>By theorem (I have to figure out how to reference and name them) (c), since <m>x \subset A</m> and <m>A \subset B</m>
            we can conclude <m>x \subset B</m>. Thus by definition of power set, <m>x \in P(B)</m></p>
        <p>Thus by direct proof, if <m>A \subset B</m> then <m>P(A) \subset P(B)</m></p>
        <p>[<m>\impliedby</m>]</p>
        <p>Assume that <m>P(A) \subset P(B)</m>. Let <m>y \in A</m> By definition of power set, <m>{y} \in P(A)</m>. Hence by
        our assumption, <m>{y} \in P(B)</m>. Hence by our assumption and the definition of power set, <m>{y} \in P(A)</m>, hence
        <m>{y} \in P(B)</m>. By definition of subset, since <m>y \in {y}</m> then <m>y \in B</m>.</p>
        <p>Thus by direct and bi-directional proof, <m>A \subset B</m> if and only if <m>P(A) \subset P(B)</m></p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-5-6">
        <title></title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                For any sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, <m>A\times (B\cup C) = (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
        <p><m>[\subset ]</m></p>
        <p>Let <m>x \in A \times (B\cup C)</m>. Hence by definition of cross product, we can find <m>m \in A</m> and <m>l \in B\cup C</m> such that 
            <m>x = (m, l)</m>. By definition of union, <m>l \in B</m> or <m>l \in C</m>. Hence <m>(m, l) \in A \times B</m>. Since <m>m \in A</m> and <m>l \in B</m>
            or <m>(m, l) \in A \times C</m>, since <m>m \in A</m> and <m>l \in C</m>. Thus, by definition of union, <m>x=(m, l) \in (A \times B) \cup (A \times C)</m>
            Thus by definition of subset, since <m>x \in A\times (B\cup C)</m> and <m>x \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>, 
            <m>A\times (B\cup C) \subset (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>.</p>
        <p><m>[\supset ]</m></p>
        <p>Let <m>x \in (A \times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>. Hence by definition of union, <m>x \in (A\times B)</m> or <m>x \in (A\times C)</m>. Hence, by definition
            of cross product, we can find <m>m\in A</m> and <m>k \in B</m> or <m>d\in A</m> and <m>l\in C</m> such that <m>x=(m, k)</m> or <m>x=(d, l)</m>.</p>
        <p><alert>Case 1:</alert> <m>x=(m, k)</m></p>
        <p>Since <m>k\in B</m>, by definition of union, <m>k\in B\cup C</m> and since <m>m\in A</m>, <m>x=(m, k) \in A\times(B\cup C)</m> by definition of 
            cross product. Thus by definition of subset, since <m>x \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m> and <m>x \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>,
            <m>(A\times B)\cup (A\times C) \subset A\times (B\cup C)</m></p>
        <p><alert>Case 2:</alert> x = (d,l)</p>
        <p>Since <m>l\in C</m>, by definition of union, <m>l\in B\cup C</m>. And since <m>d\in A</m>, by definition of cross prodcut,
            <m>x=(d,l) \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>. Thus by definition of subset, since <m>x \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m> and <m>x \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>,
            <m>(A\times B)\cup (A\times C) \subset A\times (B\cup C)</m> </p>
        <p>Thus, since both cases hold, by direct proof and proof by cases, <m>A\times (B\cup C) = (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m></p>
    </proof>
