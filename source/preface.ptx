<p>The purpose for the course/book is to help the student that is about to transition 
    from the traditional calculative courses such as the calculus sequence and begin their journey into 
    the more abstract mathematics where proofs become prevelent.</p>
    <p>
        Most students that would venture this far into the 
        mathematics major have been enjoying these calculative classes, enjoying the comfort of an algorithm. Perhaps they were the 
        student that loved Calculus III where they picutred three dimensional shapes and loved the visualiztation. Whatever
        it was I have seen far too many students then reach the more "rigorous" classes and then loose interest, changing 
        majors or just stop enjoying mathematics. In my opinion this is just a shame! And this text tries to give students
        an algorithm to hold on to as they move deeper and deeper into the muddle.

<p><alert>To the Teacher:</alert></p>
<p>I don't know how you stumbled upon this book, but if you are reading this
    you are most likely deciding if you should adopt this textbook in your class.
    I'll save you the work: DO IT! 
</p>
<p>
    What? Are you still reading? Ohhh... you want more of an explanation. Well, first
    this book is free, stop making your students pay for expensive books! 
</p>
<p>
    Still here I see... You are more decenering. Well if you want to know if my exercises are of your taste. 
    I assure you I broke no molds in the exercises. In this textbook Students will prove the traditional even, odd, divides, etc. 
</p>
<p>
    Wait... you are still reading... ok people might ask what you are doing... quick giggle and say:  
</p>
<p>
    "that's a funny tiktok" 
</p>
<p>
    That was close... didn't want your colleagues walking by to think you actually cared about student learning... so you want to know if this is differnt than those other introduction
    to proofs book... Well let me tell you a story...
</p>
<p>I've had nights out at conferences with fellow mathematicians and have listened to 
    these brilliant mathematicians lament on not understanding the purpose of a course
    on proof writing. And when these pillars of our mathematics community ever taught such a class it was with
    the outlook that someone learned to write proofs by seeing a lot of proofs. So the instructor would show off some proofs
    never really motivating why or how one would move from one line to the next then grab some questions from the exercise
    section and just hope their students would figure it out. 
</p>
<p>
    By my flippant description of this interaction you probally put together that I don't feel this way. I feel like students
    can be led on the proving journey the same as they are led are their calculative journey. Just more care should
    be taken. I have attempted to create a text that allows the instructor to just "follow the chapters" in their present
    order and hopefully give the student's this journey!
</p>
<p>
    Ok... but you are till reading... Yes you may be asking why are my examples so "basic" I never once mention derivative 
    like the popular texts in this subject by the big publishers... well this is because I save that for analysis... in
    this course I am just trying to introduce proving not introduce topics that cannot be picked up (almost) immediately. 
</p>
<p>
    Now, if you are curious of my ethos/outlook on proofs or that of advanced/abstract mathematics to see if it
    aligns with yours and you have yet been scared away by this preface, then I'd suggest you go ahead and read that
    first chapter. It is short and describes my ethos. 
</p>
<p>
    Finally, I'm sure you have already looked me up... but I'm definetly not a number theorist... sorry in advance!
