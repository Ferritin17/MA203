    <note>Memorize this. Anyone who has been through this course shall know how to do this proof.</note>
    <p><alert>Prove:</alert> <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.</p>

    <p>Before we begin any proof we sing our song, although it is a little different when we're using contradiction (play-along):</p>

        <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
        <answer>
        <p>Rational, relatively prime, and divides (create reference here!)</p>

        <p>"Now, what to do?"</p>

        <p>Proof by contradiction - because I said so!</p>

    <p>Assume that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational. That is, it is not true that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational</p>

    <p>Thus, per the definition of rational, we can find two relatively prime integers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> so that 
    <m>\sqrt{2} =\frac{p}{q}</m> (This is <m>Q</m></p>
    <p>Calculate:</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>\text{square both sides: }2\amp=\frac{p^2}{q^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{multiply both sides by }q^2: 2q^2\amp=p^2</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>But, <m>q^2</m> is an integer, thus, <m>p^2</m> is even!</p>
    <p>Hence, by Pythagoras' Lemma (REFERENCE NEEDED), <m>p</m> is even!</p>
    <p>Thus we can find an integer (Note the shoveling off of the invisible quantifier from the definition of even)
        <m>m</m> so that <m>p=2m</m></p>

    <p>Calculate again:</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>2q^2\amp=(2m)^2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=4m^2</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Divide both sides by 2 } q^2\amp=2m^2</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>But <m>m^2</m> is an integer, so, by definition of even, <m>q^2</m> is even, and by Pythagoras' Lemma, <m>q</m> is even.</p>
    <p>Since <m>2\mid p</m> and <m>2\mid q</m>, <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are not relatively prime! (This is the <m>\sim Q</m> part)</p>

    <p>Thus we have shown <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> to be relatively prime <alert>and</alert> not relatively prime.</p>
    <p>Thus by proof by contradiction, we have shown that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.</p>

    <p>Now let's see everything written together in a single spot.</p>
