  <title>Introduction to Logic</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter we will see the foundation of proofs, namely propositional logic. Logic has become so
      prevalent in an invisible way as it is the underlying language of the technology that has began running our lives.

      In more of a historical context logic was the primary tool for the original philosophers and debaters. The study
      of propositional logic teaches you how to argue! It is in simpliest terms the study of truth.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>True</alert> or <alert>False</alert> 
    </p>
    <p>
      The quintessential <alert>1</alert> or <alert>0</alert> of computers.
