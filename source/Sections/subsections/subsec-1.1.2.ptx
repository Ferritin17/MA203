    <p>Individual propositions can be combined into compound propositions using <term>connectives</term>, such as <term>and</term> and <term>or</term>.</p>
    <p>Instead of writing out the entire proposition, we can use logic notation, where propositions are represented with a chosen variable and connectives are represented by symbols.</p>
    <p><m>\wedge</m> = and, <m>\vee</m> = or</p>
    <p>We often want to negate statements, for which we use <m>\sim </m> or <m>\neg</m> as <term>not</term>.</p>

    <example>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "It is raining outside."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I have an umbrella."</p>
                <p><m>P\wedge Q </m> : It is raining outside and I have an umbrella.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I will go to the store tonight"</p>
                <p><m>~P</m> : "I will not go to the store tonight."</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I will do my homework."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I will watch Star Wars."</p>
                <p><m>P\vee Q</m> : "I will do my homework or I will watch Star Wars."</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I will do the dishes tonight."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I am cooking tonight."</p>
                <p><m>P\wedge (\sim Q)</m> : "I will do the dishes tonight, and I am not cooking tonight."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </example>

    <p>There is another way to relate two propositions, that is, with an <term>implication</term>, which is written like this: <m>\implies</m>.</p>
    <example>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I am cooking tonight."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I will do the dishes."</p>
                <p><m>P\implies Q</m> : "If I am cooking tonight, then I will do the dishes."</p>
                <p><m>P\implies (\sim Q)</m> : "If I am cooking tonight, then I will not do the dishes."</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><m>P</m> : "I am elected."</p>
                <p><m>Q</m> : "I will lower taxes."</p>
                <p><m>P\implies Q</m> : "If I am elected, then I will lower taxes."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

    </example>
