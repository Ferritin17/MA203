<title>What is a contradiction?</title>
<p>New proving method! Proof by contradiction.</p>
<p>This is a fun one - more Latin! Now that we know more than one proving method, we need to let our reader know what we're doing
    So when doing a proof by contradiction, we put [RAA] at the top which stands for <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, that is, 
    "reduction to absurdity."</p>
<p>A proof by contradiction proves <m>P</m></p>

    <title>Proof by Contradiction of <m>P</m></title>
      
    <p>
        Assume <m>\sim P</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\vdots</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore <m>Q</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\vdots</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore <m>\sim Q</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus <m>Q\wedge \sim Q</m> which is a contradicition.
    </p>
    <p>Thus <m>\sim P</m> is not valid.</p>
