    <p>A direct proof is the easiest way to prove an implication. That is, it proves things in the form <m>P\implies Q</m>.
    We assume P, make some premises, and conclude Q.</p>
    <p>The following jingle is a handy mnemonic for remembering the "steps" to writing a direct proof:</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>What's the P? (The "if" part)</li>
            <li>What's the Q? (The "then" part)</li>
            <li>What're the definitions?</li>
            <li>Now, what to do? (Which proving method - until we learn more this will always be direct proof)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
