<title>Exhaustive Examples</title>
    <p>
       We now include some examples, the first one is an example 
    </p>

    <p><alert>Prove:</alert> for any integer <m>a</m>, <m>a(a+1)</m> is even.</p>
    <p>Let <m>a</m> be an integer. <m>a</m> is either even, or odd.</p>
    <p><alert>Case 1:</alert> Assume <m>a</m> is even.</p>
    <p>Hence by definition of even, we can find an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a=2k</m>.</p>
    <p>Calculate:</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>a(a+1)\amp=2k(2k+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=4k^2+2k</mrow>
        <mrow>2(k*k+k)</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Thus, since <m>k^2+k</m> is an integer, by definition of even, <m>a(a+1)</m> is even. Thus by direct proof, 
        if <m>a</m> is even then <m>a(a+1)</m> is even.</p>
    <p><alert>Case 2:</alert> Assume <m>a</m> is odd. Thus by definitino of odd, we can find an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>a=2m+1</m></p>
    <p>Calculate</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>a(a+1)\amp=(2m+1)(2m+1+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=(2m+1)(2(m+1))</mrow>
        <mrow>2[(2m+1)(2m+1)</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Thus since <m>(2m+1)(2m+1)</m> is an integer, according to the definition of even, <m>a(a+1)</m> is even. Thus by direct proof 
        if <m>a</m> is odd then <m>a(a+1)</m> is even.</p>
    <p>Thus since case 1 and case 2 hold, by proof by cases, and by direct proof, <m>a(a+1)</m> is even. <m>\square</m></p>
