<title>In the Beginning We Had Shapes</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    As was true in ancient Athens, seems to ring true still in our sacred halls of academia, even more true after Bourbaki 
    came in with their wrecking ball, and that is: 
</p>
<p>
    ΑΓΕΩΜΕΤΡΗΤΟΣ ΜΗΔΕΙΣ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ
</p>

<p>
    Of course if that was "all Greek to you," do not fret fair Caesar, that was simply the author paying tribute to those 
    that came before... 
</p>
<p>
    The history of math books are littered with reference to tax collectors and assesors, but besides the lousy 
    adjectives that we call numbers we have had <alert>Geometry!</alert>

    <title>Undefined Terms</title>
    
    

<p>
    Once Euclid was ready to formalize this universal experience of geometry he did so by introducing perhaps the most
    powerful and important concepts in all of philosophy and mathematics. The <em>undefined term</em>.
</p>
<p>
    As one is defining a word they must of course use <em>more words</em>, then those words would of course need 
    even more <em>words</em> to define them... and so on.... and so forth.  
</p>
<p>
    When would this pattern end? We would eventually need to stop. The "stopping" words are known as <alert>undefined terms</alert>
    For example the almost universally agreed upon undefined terms for geometry are: <term>point</term>, <term>line</term>,
    and <term>incident</term>. 
</p>

<section xml:id="subsec-1-1-2-axioms" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Axioms</title>
<p>
After we have all agreed on the undefined terms we would then need to set some <em>ground rules</em>. These rules
that our new undefined terms must follow are known as <term>axioms</term>. Using our geometry example from above, one
common axiom of euclidean geometry is:
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                For any two points there exists a line incident to both.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    The etymology of the word axiom comes from a Greek word meaning to require. I find this apropos as axioms are
    required - otherwise we would have no footing to begin a discourse.

    <title>Definitions</title>
    <p>
        Now once we have our undefined terms and axioms, we begin building perhaps the most important part of 
        all proofs: the <term>definitions</term>. It is one of the <alert>major take-aways</alert> from this
        course that I would like the student to understand the importance of a definition. You can only prove something
        is true when you know that thing, when you know that thing's definition.

    <title>Proofs</title>
    <p>
        There are two interpretations of what has been presented before you. One, hopefully how it has been presented
        here, is that of there is no other way one could argue/debate without this structure. Otherwise, a party could
        simply keep going backwards and backwards with no assumptions/axioms to back stop the debate. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The other point of view, perhaps most popular in textbooks, is to call this approach <term>deductive reasoning</term>,
        and draw contrast to that of <term>inductive reasoning</term>. Some how pitting the two against each other. 
        The epitome of physicists versus mathematicians. Even, applied mathematicians vs theoretical mathematicians. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The differences attempting to be drawn between the world we have just set foward and that of collecting data 
        and observing specific 
        instances or phenomena, striving to form a theory, <alert>a model</alert>, that reveals patterns or 
        relationships among quantities and structures in nature. This process labeled as inductive reasoning, drawing 
        general conclusions from particular cases/patterns. Which is supposed to be in stark oppostion to deductive reasoning, 
        where we draw conclusions based on statements accepted as true, our axioms and undefined terms. Then proofs are built, to
        ensure that conclusions are drawn logically to arrive at truth. Yet, it is impossible to seperate these. It is the phenomena
        of our surrounding universe that Euclid yearned to define and describe in his geometries. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this class we will not explore the amzaing world of tracing back every single conclusion to an undefined terms 
        and axioms, but instead we will start with A LOT of assumptions, assumptions students at this stage are used to making, namely 
        "college algebra". Then later we will use less and less assumptions.
