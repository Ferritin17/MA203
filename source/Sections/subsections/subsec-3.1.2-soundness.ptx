  <title>Soundness</title>
<p>
    We have seen examples, as should be expected by the nature of the implication, 
    where false false premises lead have false conclusions yet are valid arguments. 
    Yet, for our proofs we need to ensure that they are not lead by false assumptions.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-soundness">
    <statement>
        <p>
            An argument is <term>sound</term> when it is valid and the premises are true.
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
Our proofs will consist of a series of sound arguments that prove a given/discovered statment.

<example>
    <p>Here are some example of sound arguments:</p>
    <tabular halign="right">
