<title>An Over Explanation</title>


<p>First without the explanation:</p>
<example>
<p> <alert>Prove:</alert> For all integers <m>x</m>, whenever <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x+1</m> is even.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let <m>x</m> be an integer. Assume <m>x</m> is odd. 
Thus, by the definition of odd, we can find an integer <m>k</m> so that 
<m>x=2k+1</m>.</p> 
<p>Calculate:</p>
<md>
<mrow>x+1\amp=(2k+1)+1</mrow>
<mrow>\amp=k+2</mrow>
<mrow>\amp=2(k+1)</mrow>
</md>
<p>Since <m>k+1</m> is an integer, by definition of even, <m>x+1</m> is even. </p>
<p> Since we assumed that and arbitrary integer <m>x</m> was odd and showed that <m>x+1</m> is even, we can conclude 
that for all integers <m>x</m>, whenever <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x+1</m> is even, by direct proof. <m>\square</m>
</p> 

</example>

<p>Now lets give too much exmplanation:</p>

<example>
    <p>
       <alert>Prove:</alert> For all integers <m>x</m>, whenever <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x+1</m> is even.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Before we can jump into our proof I spy a <m>\forall</m> there...</p>
    <p> We need to "shovel off" the quantifier (<m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}</m>) by using either of the senctences:</p>
    <p> "Let <m>x</m> be an integer."</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>"Choose an arbitrary integer <m>x</m>"</p>
    <p>(this is using Universal Generalization from <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now to get our proof on the way it is helpful to use our song: (play-along with us)</p>
    <p>"What's the <m>P</m>?"</p> 
    <solution title="">
    <p><m>x</m> is odd</p>
    </solution>
    <p>"What's the <m>Q</m>?"</p> 
    <solution>
    <p><m>x+1</m> is even</p>
    </solution>
    <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
    <solution>
    <p>Odd and even! (found in <xref ref="subsec-4-1-2-terms"/>)</p>
    </solution>
    <p>"Now, what to do?"</p> 
    <solution>
    <p>A direct proof! (it is the only method we know so far)</p>
    </solution>
    
    
    <p></p>
    <p>Our song helped us identify the "<m>P</m>" which in our first step of direct proofs we <em>must</em> assume.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Assume the "<m>P</m>":</p> 
    <p>"Assume <m>x</m> is odd."</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now we don't have much expcept the definitions. (It can be helpful, especially in these early stages of proof writing, to write the 
        relevant definitions to the side in your scratch work this is why it's part of the song!)</p>
      <p>  From the definition we can make the conclusion</p> 
      <p>By the definition of odd, we can find an integer <m>k</m> so that <m>x=2k+1</m>.</p>
      <p>(using the definition and applying Existential Instantiation from <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>)</p>
      <p></p>
    <p>Now we need to actually <em>do</em> something with that. "Hence calculate:</p>
    <p>(using college algebra as allowed by <xref ref="sec-4-1-1-what-we-assume"/>)</p>
    
    <md>
        <mrow>x+1\amp=(2k+1)+1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=k+2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=2(k+1)</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>The <m>x+1</m> on the left of this equation is the end conclusion we're "aiming for." 
        (<em>"What's the <m>Q</m>"</em> from the song) The stuff on the right is what we manipulate to make it 
        "look like," or "fit," the definition of even.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we can make our conclusion. "Since <m>k+1</m> is an integer, by definition of even, <m>x+1</m> is even."</p>
    <p>(once again using the definition of even, as well as the argument Existential Generalization from <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>)</p>
    
    <p>Finally a wrap-up sentence:</p>
    <p> Since we assumed that and arbitrary integer <m>x</m> was odd and showed that <m>x+1</m> is even, we can conclude 
        that for all integers <m>x</m>, whenever <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x+1</m> is even, by direct proof. Q.E.D.
    </p> 
    
    </example>
    
 

    <note>
        <p>When a proof is finished, customarily, we either write "QED" or <m>\square</m> at the bottom. 
            This comes from the Latin "quod erat demonstrandum," which means 
            "that which was to be demonstrated."</p>
