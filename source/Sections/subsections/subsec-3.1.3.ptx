    <p>Finally, in order to start proving things we'll need some definitions. We'll start with the defintions of odd and even,
        which you'll find we can get a lot of mileage out of.</p>

    <p>
        <definition xml:id="def-even">
            <term>Even</term>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x</m> is even iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> x=2k</m>
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
    </p>

    <p>
        <definition xml:id="def-odd">
            <term>Odd</term>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x</m> is even iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> x=2k+1</m>
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
    </p>

    <p>It is important to become so familiar with these that you could say them in your sleep.</p>
