    <title>The Logic of Sets</title>
    <p>
        As we have built set theory directly from propositonal logic we can approach some basic properties very similiarly to that of <xref ref="subsec-2-4-3-logic-algebra"/>.
        Now we have the tools to start proving, we begin with the reason that most people hate the empty set.

    <proposition xml:id="prop-empty-unique">
        <statement>
            <p>
                For any set <m>A</m> the empty set is a subset of <m>A</m>, that is <me>\emptyset\subseteq A</me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </proposition>
