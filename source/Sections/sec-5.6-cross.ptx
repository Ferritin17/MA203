<title>Cross Product</title>
<p>
    In this section we introduce the concept of cross product, this is yet another way of making new sets from old sets.

<title>Cross Product</title>


    <statement>
        <p>
            Given two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> we can define a new set which we will call the <term>cross prodcut</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> (or the <term>cartiesian product</term>) defined as
            <me>
                A\times B=\{(a,b)\text{ }|\text{ }a\in A\text{ and }b\in B\}
            </me>
            
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    This is the collection of all ordered pairs. We explore this new construction in the following examples.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        Consider the sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/a_for_cross.jpeg" width="45%"/>
     <image source="/images/b_for_cross.jpeg" width="54%"/>
    <p>
        thus the cross product is the following set:
    </p>
    <image source="/images/a_cross_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
</example>
<p>
    Our next example explores the lack of commutation of the cross product.
</p>
<example>
    <p>Let's look at another cross product of some sets. Calculate <m>A\times B</m> and <m>B\times A</m> given the sets <m>A = \{2, G, E\}</m>
    and <m>B = \{\pi , e, P\}</m></p>

    <me>A\times B = \{(2, \pi), (2, e), (2, P), (G, \pi), (G, e), (G, P), (E, \pi ), (E, e), (E, P)\}</me>
    <me>B\times A = \{(\pi , 2), (\pi , G), (\pi , E), (e, 2), (e, G), (e, E), (P, 2), (P, G), (P, E)\}</me>
</example>
<p>
    The cross product has been shown since very early on in your mathematical education mostly the ordered pairs you would consider was the cartiesian plane, the good ol' <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axis.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        This time if we consider a set I've tried vary hard to stay away from, namely the real numbers, <m>\R</m>. Then the cartesian plane is the set <m>\R\times \R</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout your youth you have surely seen many points illustrated on this cartiesian plane, such as the elements <m>{\color{red}(1,3)}</m>, <m>{\color{blue}(2,-2)}</m>, and <m>{\color{green}(-2,-1)}</m>

<theorem xml:id="thm-5-6">
    <title></title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            For any sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, <m>A\times (B\cup C) = (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>
        </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p><m>[\subset ]</m></p>
    <p>Let <m>x \in A \times (B\cup C)</m>. Hence by definition of cross product, we can find <m>m \in A</m> and <m>l \in B\cup C</m> such that 
        <m>x = (m, l)</m>. By definition of union, <m>l \in B</m> or <m>l \in C</m>. Hence <m>(m, l) \in A \times B</m>. Since <m>m \in A</m> and <m>l \in B</m>
        or <m>(m, l) \in A \times C</m>, since <m>m \in A</m> and <m>l \in C</m>. Thus, by definition of union, <m>x=(m, l) \in (A \times B) \cup (A \times C)</m>
        Thus by definition of subset, since <m>x \in A\times (B\cup C)</m> and <m>x \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>, 
        <m>A\times (B\cup C) \subset (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>.</p>
    <p><m>[\supset ]</m></p>
    <p>Let <m>x \in (A \times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>. Hence by definition of union, <m>x \in (A\times B)</m> or <m>x \in (A\times C)</m>. Hence, by definition
        of cross product, we can find <m>m\in A</m> and <m>k \in B</m> or <m>d\in A</m> and <m>l\in C</m> such that <m>x=(m, k)</m> or <m>x=(d, l)</m>.</p>
    <p><alert>Case 1:</alert> <m>x=(m, k)</m></p>
    <p>Since <m>k\in B</m>, by definition of union, <m>k\in B\cup C</m> and since <m>m\in A</m>, <m>x=(m, k) \in A\times(B\cup C)</m> by definition of 
        cross product. Thus by definition of subset, since <m>x \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m> and <m>x \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>,
        <m>(A\times B)\cup (A\times C) \subset A\times (B\cup C)</m></p>
    <p><alert>Case 2:</alert> x = (d,l)</p>
    <p>Since <m>l\in C</m>, by definition of union, <m>l\in B\cup C</m>. And since <m>d\in A</m>, by definition of cross prodcut,
        <m>x=(d,l) \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>. Thus by definition of subset, since <m>x \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m> and <m>x \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>,
        <m>(A\times B)\cup (A\times C) \subset A\times (B\cup C)</m> </p>
    <p>Thus, since both cases hold, by direct proof and proof by cases, <m>A\times (B\cup C) = (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m></p>
