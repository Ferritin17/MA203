<title>Logical Equivalences</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        In this course students will often treat this beginning material of propositions and truth tables
         as not connected to the proofs, and just a way to get some good grades on early homework. I cannot blaim
         the student for this, when thrown into an unknown world it is hard to hold on-to everything.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, we will now dive into equivalences. In the world of proving it may often be difficult to prove a statement 
        how it appears in the homework, or how you first discovered it, but if you were to simply re-word it, now it
        becomes simplier to prove. These rewordings are the equivalences.
