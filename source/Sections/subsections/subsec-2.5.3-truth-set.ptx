<title>Truth Sets and Predicate Forms</title>

<p>
    When we are discussing a general universe of discuourse we will denote it as <m>mathcal{U}</m>. We will also often need 
    to speak of a predicate in general terms so we will use the <em>function</em> notation for predicates. Such
    as for the predicate <m>x\geq 3</m> we can denote it by <m>P(x)</m>.
