<title>In the Beggining We Had Shapes</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    As was true in ancient Athens, seems to ring true still in our sacred halls of academia, even more true after Bourbaki 
    came in with their wrecking ball, and that is: 
</p>
<p>
    ΑΓΕΩΜΕΤΡΗΤΟΣ ΜΗΔΕΙΣ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ
</p>

<p>
    Of course if that was "all greek to you" do not fret fair Ceasar, that was simply the author paying tribute to those 
    that came before...

    <title>Undefined Terms</title>
    
    
<p>
    The history of math books are littered with reference to tax collectors and assesors, but besides the lousey 
    adjectives that we call numbers we have had <alert>Geometry!</alert>
</p>
<p>
    Once Euclid was ready to formalize this universal experience of geometry he did so by introducing perhaps the most
    powerful and important concepts in all of philosophy and mathematics. The <em>undefined term</em>.
</p>
<p>
    As one is defining a word they must of course use <em>more words</em>, then those words would of course need 
    even more <em>words</em> to define them... and so on.... and so forth.  
</p>
<p>
    When would this pattern end? We would eventually need to stop. The "stopping" words are known as <alert>undefined terms</alert>
</p>
<p>
    In this class we will not explore the amzaing world of tracing back every single conclusion to an undefined terms 
    but instead we will start with A LOT of assumptions, assumptions students at this stage are used to making, namely 
    "college algebra". Then later we will use less and less assumptions.
