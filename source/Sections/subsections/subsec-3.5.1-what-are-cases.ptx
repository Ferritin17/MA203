<title>What are Cases?</title>

<p>
    Unlike the example in <xref ref="sec-1-2-checking"/> where the are an unlimited amount of integers to choose from, 
    sometimes we have a finite and more tenable collection of possibilities and we could actually check or prove in each 
    of these situations.
</p>
<p>
    Some examples of when we have such a list, that we will consider, are the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\forall x\in\Z</m> we have either <m>x</m> is even or <m>x</m> is odd.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\forall x,y\in\Z</m> either <m>x|y</m> or <m>x|(y-r)</m> for some integer <m>0\lt r\lt |x|</m> 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\forall x\in\R</m> either <m>x\geq 0</m> or <m>x\lt0</m>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <p>
        We will now prove that it is actually true that the first two have only those cases. We do this with a single 
        statement as the first one is a just a special instance of the second one.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-remainders">
        <statement>
            <p>
                For any two integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, there exists an <m>r\in\Z</m> such that <m>0\leq r\lt |x|</m> and <m>x|(y-r)</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
        <p>
            Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be integers. By the division algorithm from <xref ref="sec-4-1-1-what-we-assume"/>
            we can find a <m>q,r\in\Z</m> such that <m>0\leq r\lt |x|</m> and <m>y=qx+r</m>. Hence subtracting both sides
            by <m>r</m> we get <m>y-r=qx</m> since <m>q</m> is an integer by the definition of divides (<xref ref="defn-divides"/>)
            we have that <m>x|(y-r)</m>.  
        </p>
    </proof>
