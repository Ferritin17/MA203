  <title>Arguments</title>
  <p>Arguments are so important, they almost merited their own chapter. Every argument contains one or more premises/assumptions, and a conclusion.
    An argument is valid when the premises true means the conclusion is true.</p>
  <p><m>(A\wedge B)\implies C</m>: When both A <em>and</em> B are true is the only time C <em>must</em> be true. Then the argument is valid.</p>
  <p> Below is the basic form of an argument:</p>

  <sidebyside>
    <tabular halign="right">
      <row>
        <cell>A</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="medium">
        <cell>B</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><m>\therefore </m> C</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>Where A and B are the premises/assumptions, and C is the conclusion.</p>
    <p><m> \therefore </m> = "therefore/hence/so" etc.</p>
  </sidebyside>

  <example>
    <p>Here are some example of valide arguments:</p>
    <tabular halign="right">
      <row>
        <cell>All parabolas are functions of degree 2</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="medium">
        <cell>All functions of degree 2 are quadratic</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><m>\therefore </m> All parabolas are quadratic</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <tabular halign="right">
      <row>
        <cell>The sun is purple</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="medium">
        <cell>The sun is a planet</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><m>\therefore </m> The sun is purple</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <tabular halign="right">
      <row>
        <cell>All spiders have 8 legs</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="medium">
        <cell>A poodle is a spider</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><m>\therefore </m> A poodle has 8 legs</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    
    <p>Here is an example of an invalid argument:</p>

    <tabular halign="right">
      <row>
        <cell>All cows are animals that eat grass</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="medium">
        <cell>All cows are animals that moo</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><m>\therefore </m> All animals that eat grass moo</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
  </example>
  
  <p>Notice that it is not the truth of the premises that makes an argument valid or invalid, but rather the truth of the conclusion.</p>

  <remark>
    <p><term>Modus Ponens</term> is a specific type of argument with two premises: <m>P\implies Q</m>, and <m>P</m>, and conludes <m>Q</m>.
      An example of this is "If it is Tuesday then John will go to work. It is Tuesday. Therefore John will go to work."</p>
