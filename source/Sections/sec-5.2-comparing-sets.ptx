<title>Comparing and Combining Sets</title>
<p>
    Now we will begin comparing sets. Our first tool of comparison is the concept of subset.
</p>
<definition xml:id="defn-subset">
    <title>Subset</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
           We say that the set <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of a set <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\subseteq B</m>, if and only if for all <m>x\in\mathcal{U}</m>, <me>x \in A \implies x \in B</me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    To say that in more plain language, <m>A\subseteq B</m> means <m>B</m> contains all the elements of <m>A</m>, it is noteworthy that <m>B</m> may contain more than just those elements from <m>A</m>.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        Consider the sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/first_set.jpeg" width="72.5%"/>
    <image source="/images/set_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
        notice that every element from <m>A</m> can also be found in <m>B</m>, that is <m>A\subseteq B</m>.
    </p>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        Define the sets 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=6a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
        </me>
        <me>
            B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Notice that <m>A\subseteq B</m> since for any <m>x\in A</m> we can find an integer <m>a</m> such that 
        <me>
            x=6a=2\cdot(3a)
        </me>
        and since <m>3a</m> is an integer by definition <m>x\in B</m>.
    </p>
    
</example>
<p>
    We now venture into combining sets, that is making new sets given one or more sets. 
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-union">
    <title>Union</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            We define the <term>union</term> of two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cup B</m> as the set:
        </p>
        <p><me>A \cup B = \{x\text{ } |\text{ } x \in A \vee x \in B\}</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>As is done for a set, we must define what it takes for membership to this set. For the union membership is allowed when membership of either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> is established.
    In more common vernacular, this says that the union of two sets is anything from either set.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        Consider the following sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/first_set.jpeg" width="65%"/>
    <image source="/images/new_b.jpeg" width="62%"/>
    <p>
        then the union of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is as follows
    </p>
    <image source="/images/union.jpeg" width="100%"/>
  </example>
  <example>
   <p>
    Define the sets 
    <me>
        A=\{x\in\R\text{ }|\text{ }0\leq x\lt10\}
    </me>
    <me>
        B=\{x\in\R\text{ }|\text{ }-10\lt x\lt 0\}
    </me>
    Thus the union of these two sets is
    <me>
        A\cup B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }-10\lt x\lt 10\}
    </me>
    since any real number between -10 and 10 are either included between 0 and 10 or between -10 and 0.
   </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    Another way to combine sets is to only consider the elements in which they share, this is our next definition.
  </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-intersection">
    <title>Intersection</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <term>intersection</term> of two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cap B</m>, is defined as
        </p>
        <p><me>A \cap B = \{x \text{ }|\text{ } x \in A \wedge x \in B\}</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>Again, as these are sets, we must define what it means to be a member of this set. For the intersection membership is defined for those elements that have membership to both the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Or in other words, the intersection only has the things that are shared between two sets.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        Consider the following sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/intersect_a.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <image source="/images/intersect_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
        therefore the intersection of these two sets are
    </p>
    <image source="/images/intersection.jpeg" width="96%"/>
    <p>
        Notice that elements in the intersection are exactly those that show up in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    </p>
  </example>
  <example>
    <p>
        Define the sets 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }0\lt x\leq 10\}
        </me>
        <me>
            B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Thus the intersection of these two sets is
        <me>
            A\cap B=\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}
        </me>
        since those are the only even integers between 0 and 10 (including 10).
       </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    The last construction showed where two sets were the same yet, now we explore where they differ.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-set-difference">
    <title>Difference</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <term>difference</term> of a set <m>A</m> and a set <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A-B</m>, is the set defined as
        </p>
        <p><me>A-B = \{x \text{ }|\text{ } x \in A \wedge x \not\in B\}</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>The difference of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> consists of the things that are in <m>A</m>, but not in <m>B</m>.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        Consider the sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/intersect_a.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <image source="/images/intersect_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
        thus the set difference of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is
    </p>
    <image source="/images/difference.jpeg" width="68%"/>
    <p>
        notice that the difference is made up only of elements that appear in <m>A</m> yet do not appear in <m>B</m>.
    </p>
  </example>
  <example>
    <p>
        Define the sets 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }0\lt x\lt 10\}
        </me>
        <me>
            B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Thus the difference of these two sets is
        <me>
            A- B=\{1,3,5,7,9\}
        </me>
        since these are there integers between 0 and 10 that are not even.
       </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    To end this section we have been quite flipant on our universe of discourse, yet with a well defined one we can look at the set difference involving the universe.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-compliment">
    <title>Compliment</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <term>compliment</term> of a set <m>A</m> in the universe <m>\mathcal{U}</m>, is defined as the following set,
        </p>
        <p><me>A^c = \{x \in \mathcal{U} \text{ }|\text{ } x \not\in A\}</me> or <me>A^c = \mathcal{U}-A</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>The compliment can, perhaps, most simply be stated as everything that is not in <m>A</m>.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        For this example consider the universe of discord as the intergers, <m>\mathcal{U}=\Z</m>, and consider the set of all even numbers, that is the set 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Then the compliment of <m>A</m> is all the integers that are not even, or in-lieu of <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have that 
        <me>
            A^c=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y+1\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        
    </p>
  </example>
