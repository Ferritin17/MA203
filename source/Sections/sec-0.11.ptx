<title>Just Check a Bunch</title>
<p>
    Students are probably most familiar with the natural and social sciences, where theories are tested by comparing what 
    happens in experiments to what was predicted, and checking that the results stay the same when the experiment is repeated. 
    In math, often, the goal is to figure out whether a statement is always true. Even if a statement works for a lot of 
    examples, there's still the chance that one example we haven't tested could show it's false. For example, 
    you might notice that the expression
</p>
<p> 
<me>x^2-3x+43</me>
</p>
<p>
produces a prime number for <em>many</em> values of <m>x</m>. The dilligent student will check that for the first 10, 20, 
or even 42 positive integers when we substiute our number for <m>x</m> we arive at a prime number such as
</p>
<p>
    <me>(4)^2-3(4)+43=47</me>
</p>
<p> 
which is prime! If this hard working student were to check with other numbers like 44, 45, 47, and 50 they would also
discover prime numbers as the solution. 
</p>
<p>
However, this is not conclusive proof, as it fails for <m>x = 43</m>, where the result is 1763, 
which factors as <m>41\times 43</m>. While examining specific examples can offer valuable insights into 
mathematical concepts and relationships, it is not sufficient for proof unless every possible case can be examined.
