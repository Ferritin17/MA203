<title>Venn Diagrams</title>
<p>
    To understand/describe the relationship between sets we often use a tool known as <term>Venn Diagrams</term>. In simpliest terms a Venn diagram is a drawing representing the sets we are considering, we draw a circle for each set, and imagine the elements are inside the circle.
