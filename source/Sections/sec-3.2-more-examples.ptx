  <title>The Good and The Bad</title>
<p>
    There are many ways to make a valid argument, and many ways to make an invalid argument. As a student of proofs
    it is inevitable that you will make all of the mistakes, and find new and amazing ways of
     making invalid arguments, it is unavoidable. But, don't fret, that is the beautiful learning journey you are on!

<p>
  Lets begin this section with <em>The Good</em>, that is sound arguments. To make a good valid argument you should assume 
  things that are true, how these are used as <em>steps</em> is you will have (in an earlier step) either 
  assumed something to be true blindly, or have drawn a conclusion, and established the truth of a statement(s).
  You will then use these to conclude a new statment, which needs to also be true.

  This next example is not mathematical, as I am trying my best to deliver these ideas in a broader context,
  with little background information.

    So lets set a universe <m>\mathcal{U}=</m>every day of 2024. Then take the premise that 
    there exitsts a day that it rained in Terre Haute (true). Take as another premise
