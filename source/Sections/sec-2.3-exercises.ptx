            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Rewrite the statement in English without using the symbols <m>\forall</m> or <m>\exists</m>. Express your answer as simply as possible. 
                Then write a negation for the statement. Determine which statement is true, the original or the negation.
                <ol>
                    <li><m>\exists \text{ a book } b, \forall \text{ people } p, p \text{ has read } b.</m></li>

                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Rewrite the statement formally using quantifiers and variables. Write the negation of the statement.
                <ol>
                    <li>Everybody trusts somebody.</li>
                    <li>Somebody trusts everybody.</li>

                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Often it is necessary to convert an informal mathematical statement into a more formal one. Complete the following statments so they are 
                equivalent to "The reciprocal of any positive number is positive."
                <ol>
                    <li>Given an positive real number <m>r</m>, the reciprocal of ____.</li>
                    <li>For any real number <m>r</m>, if <m>r</m> is ___ then ___.</li>
                    <li>If a real number <m>r</m> ___, then ___.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Complete the following statements so they are equivalent to "The cube root of any negative real number is negative."
                <ol>
                    <li>Given any real number <m>s</m>, the cube root of ___.</li>
                    <li>For any real number <m>s</m>, if <m>s</m> is ___, then ___.</li>
                    <li>If a real number <m>s</m>, then ___.</li>
                </ol>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In order to better understand mathematical statements, it can be helpful to write statements less formally. First rewrite each
                statement without using variables, then determine whether the statements are true or false.
                <ol>
                    <li>There are real numbers <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> with the property that <m>u+v&lt;v-u</m></li>
                    <li>There is a real number <m>x</m> such that <m>x^2&lt;x</m>.</li>
                    <li>For all positive integers <m>n, n^2\geq n</m>.</li>
                    <li>For all real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b, |a+b| \leq |a|+|b|</m>.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fill in the blanks to rewrite the statement "Every nonzero real number has a reciprocal."
                <ol>
                    <li>All nonzero real numbers ___.</li>
                    <li>For all nonzero real numbers <m>r</m>, there is ___ for <m>r</m>.</li>
                    <li>For all nonzero real numbers <m>r</m>, there is a real number <m>s</m> such that ___.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Write the negation of each of the statements.
                <ol>
                    <li><m>\forall \text{ real numbers } x, \text{ if } x &gt; 3 \text { then } x^2 &gt; 9</m>.</li>
                    <li><m>\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> if <m>n</m> is prime then <m>n</m> is odd or <m>n=2</m>.</li>
                    <li><m>\forall </m> integers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is divisible by 6, then <m>n</m> is divisible by 2 and <m>n</m> is divisible by 3.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Assume that the truth value assignments for each statement are correct.
                <ul>
                    <li>All math students are sleep-deprived. (True)</li>
                    <li>All sleep-deprived people are goofy. (True)</li>
                    <li>All sleep-deprived people are math students. (False)</li>
                    <li>All math students are goofy. (True)</li>
                </ul>
                Now given these assigned truth values, determine the validity and soundness of each of the following arguments:
