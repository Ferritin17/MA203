  <title>Introduction to Logic</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter we will see the foundation of proofs, namely propositional logic. Logic has become so
      prevalent in an invisible way as it is the underlying language of the technology that has began running our lives. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In more of a historical context logic was the primary tool for the original philosophers and debaters. The study
      of propositional logic teaches you how to argue! It is in simpliest terms the study of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that said, in propositional logic we have only 2 options: 
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>True</alert> or <alert>False</alert> 
    </p>
    <p>
      The quintessential <alert>1</alert> or <alert>0</alert> of computers.
    </p>
  <note>
    <p>
      This chapter is quite verbose and the student has time early on in the course to find great algrorithms like truth tables, but these quick and low hanging algorithms have the danger of distracting the student from actually learning this bedrock portion of proofs, and treating this like their calculus class where they only <em>listen</em> when an example of algorithm is put on the jukebox.
